Hello! I'm Merlijn — a Belgian game developer and programmer who plays a lot of video games.

Professionally, I split my time between three companies I founded: Mithra Games, my one-person indie studio; [Pandafish](https://pandafish.be/), a web development studio; and [MyB'eats](https://mybeats.eu/), an app and loyalty platform.

I've been tinkering with games since elementary school, building levels for Doom, Quake, Half-Life, and many more. Later, as a technical artist in the games industry. All in all I've worked on games for web, mobile, desktop and VR. These days I'm just doing my own thing with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/).

Find me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/merlijnvh.bsky.social) if you'd like to get in touch!
