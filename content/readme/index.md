Hello! I'm Merlijn, a game developer & programmer from Belgium that plays a lot of video games.

Professionally, I divide my time between the 3 companies I founded. Mithra Games, my one-man indie game studio. [Pandafish](https://pandafish.be/), a web development studio, and [MyB'eats](https://mybeats.eu/), an app and loyalty platform.

I've been tinkering with games since elementary school, building levels for Doom, Duke Nukem 3D, Quake and Half-Life. Later as a technical artist in the games industry. All in all I've worked on games for web, mobile, desktop and VR. These days I'm just doing my own thing with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/).
