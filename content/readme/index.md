Howdy! I'm Merlijn — a Belgian game developer and programmer who plays a lot of video games.

Professionally, I split my time between the three companies I founded: Mithra Games, my one-person indie studio; [Pandafish](https://pandafish.be/), a web development studio; and [MyB'eats](https://mybeats.eu/), an app and loyalty platform.

I've been tinkering with games since elementary school, building levels for Doom, Quake, modding Half-Life, and so on. Later, as a technical artist and programmer in the games industry. These days I'm just doing my own thing with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/).

I probably sink way too many hours on my favorite shooter [Hunt: Showdown](https://huntshowdown.com/), and I have a [big ol' soft spot for westerns](https://youtube.com/watch?v=enuOArEfqGo). Pew pew.

Find me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/merlijnvh.bsky.social) if you'd like to get in touch!
