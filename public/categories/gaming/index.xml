      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months, my girlfriend and I have been spending a lot of time with &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.steampowered.com/app/526870/Satisfactory/&#34;&gt;Satisfactory&lt;/a&gt;, and it&amp;rsquo;s safe to say we&amp;rsquo;ve become pretty addicted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satisfactory is a game about factory management and planetary exploration (and exploitation). As a pioneer for FICSIT Inc., you drop onto an alien world with just a handful of tools. Your mission: harvest natural resources to construct increasingly complex automated factories. Think conveyor belts, lots of them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Today marks Quake&amp;rsquo;s 25th anniversary, which also happens to coincide with my birthday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quake released on June 22, 1996. I was still in elementary school and I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely sure how I first got my hands on it, probably through my cousin, but my dad and I were instantly &lt;em&gt;hooked&lt;/em&gt; and played daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quake wasn&amp;rsquo;t just among the first fully 3D, real‑time‑rendered FPS games; it was executed so well that it still holds up today, and that quality is what makes it unforgettable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
