Clear a district and you’re rewarded with a projected video inside the VR space that dives deeper into the pollution issue.\nIt’s sort of an interactive museum piece, really.\nBoth young and old came to experience the VR game.\nPlayers move between green waypoints, which helps prevent motion sickness.\nAfter a few months of development, I had the luxury of travelling to Taiwan and visiting HTC’s headquarters to demo the project. Once the project received approval, the VR experience was exhibited to the public during an awareness campaign, where anyone could come and try it.\nThe HTC office had a Vive logo made from old VR hardware, neat!\nOne of the biggest challenges was not knowing the final hardware target before I came to Taiwan. VR games render the scene twice, once per eye, so about half of development went into pre-optimisation. Stuttering and low frame rate are the primary causes of motion sickness, especially for first time users.\nTaipei at night is a photography heaven, if you’re into that kind of thing.\nOn the optimisation side, Unity’s occlusion culling and LODs did the heavy lifting. I baked occlusion data for the city blocks so the GPU only drew what the camera could actually see, and used LOD Groups plus static batching/instancing to keep draw calls down. Combined with the portal system, that kept frame times stable.\nIt’s the sort of project I look back on and mostly see what I’d improve. Still, I’m proud of what we accomplished.\nTaiwan is still beautiful and warm during december, not nearly as dark as the game.\nOne last Yakult \u0026 grapefruit bubble tea, before flying back home to Belgium.\n",
