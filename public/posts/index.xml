      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to bring my website back for a while now, having been less active on social media these years. In an era of brain rot, the time has come we return to the personal website &amp;amp; blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The annual bill for my webhosting was substantial, leading me to cancel it at some point. My previous websites were usually made with Wordpress, which provides a nice back-end for managing content. However, the requirement for PHP, a MySQL database, and ideally frequent updates to keep everything secure always felt too bloated for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
