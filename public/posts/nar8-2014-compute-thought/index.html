Classic cyberpunk stories like Blade Runner and Ghost in the Shell inspired me.\nDevelopment I initially tried to stage a dramatic outdoor crime scene: rain, reflective streets, harsh neon lights. What I pictured never matched what appeared on screen; the outdoor set felt empty, unfocused. After several attempts I pivoted to indoor spaces exclusively: tighter, more readable, easier to finish.\nOriginally the game flow was: character introduction, learn the interface, travel to the crime scene, burst through the door (pistol drawn) to confront the murderer. That last action sequence was cut later to keep scope under control; simplification let me ship a coherent vertical slice instead of an unfinished set piece.\nThe first prototype, the detective standing over the body.\nThe prototype grew into a night‑market scene which I later abandoned.\nTechnical \u0026 Code Implementing the point‑and‑click layer was the most fun. Hovering over an interactable object switches to a duplicate of the 3D mesh, but with an additive shader, offset slightly to create an animated parallax effect.\nClicking an object queues a pathfinding action to have the character walk over, then opens a dialogue window. All dialogue was authored in Twine for fast iteration. Each Twine file is assigned to an object in the editor.\nScene management inside the Unity editor.\nLate in development I added a computer terminal. This is where the detective investigates the crime scene and the victim’s files. It accepts real keyboard input, plays tactile clicky typing sounds, validates input against a list of possible commands, renders text off‑screen on a texture, then draws it in the game world. There was groundwork for browsing around the full hard-drive too, but I couldn’t flesh it out before the deadline.\nEnvironment \u0026 Characters All the assets were modeled in Blender, and lit in Unity using a strong directional light and bloom effects. A simple additive skybox help sell the glow coming through the windows. Most props were simply left flat‑shaded.\nThe computer is placed close to camera in the finale to signal its importance.\nCharacter work was hardest. I usually build “cute” stylized things, so a more life-like human posed a challenge. The walk cycle went through multiple iterations; it’s still imperfect, and the slight slide from idle to walk cycle bothered me most, but it reached an acceptable level for the jam.\nIn Closing Building Compute Thought in roughly two weeks of spare time was satisfying. I probably wrote more words in this post than all of the game’s dialogue, still plenty to learn on the narrative side. With more time I would have added more interactions and expanded on existing systems; for a story‑driven game, interactivity is thin.\nAs a first itch.io release it performed modestly: about eight plays a day, fine for a game jam entry and likely more than my Ludum Dare #29 game.\n",
