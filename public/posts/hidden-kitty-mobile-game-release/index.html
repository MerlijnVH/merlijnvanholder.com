Hidden Kitty is a cute seek‑and‑find game. Explore the rooms of the house and figure out where the kitty is hiding. Behind a pillow? Inside a cupboard? Tap and slide things around to discover new spots.

There&rsquo;s lots of objects in the house to interact with.
This summer I wanted to build something smaller and cute than what I was already working on. Unlike my previous mobile game Pilot Express, which was free‑to‑play, Hidden Kitty is a paid download, something I&rsquo;d been wanting to explore for a while.">
