Pilot Express lets you fly a small plane up and down, avoiding obstacles such as mines and balloons along the way. Collect coins to increase your score and fly through hoops to gain a speed boost. The controls are simple and responsive, so the challenge comes from reacting quick enough, flying through tight gaps, and deciding when to go for the bonus items versus playing it safe.">
